The gr-gsm project 
==================
The *gr-gsm* project is based on the *gsm-receiver* written by Piotr Krysik (also the main author of *gr-gsm*) for the *Airprobe* project.

The aim is to provide set of tools for receiving information transmitted by GSM equipment/devices.

Installation and usage
======================
Please see project's [wiki](https://osmocom.org/projects/gr-gsm/wiki/index) for information on [installation](https://osmocom.org/projects/gr-gsm/wiki/Installation) and [usage](https://github.com/ptrkrysik/gr-gsm/wiki/Usage) of gr-gsm.

Mailing list
============
Current gr-gsm project's mailing list address is following:

gr-gsm@googlegroups.com

Mailing list is a place for general discussions, questions about the usage and installation. In case of problem with installation please try to provide full information that will help reproducing it. Minimum information should contain:
- operating system with version,
- kind of installation (how gr-gsm and its dependencies were installed: with pybombs, from distibution's repository, compiled manually)
- version of gnuradio (it can be obtained with: gnuradio-companion --version)
- error messages (in case of pybombs installation they can be obtained after switching it to verbous mode with -v option).

To join the group with any e-mail address, use this link:

Development
===========
New features are accepted through github's pull requests. When creating pull request try to make it adress one topic (addition of a feature x, correction of bug y).

If you wish to develop something for gr-gsm but don't know exactly what, then look for issues with label "Enhancement". Select one that you feel you are able to complete. After that claim it by commenting in the comment section of the issue. If there is any additional information about gr-gsm needed by you to make completing the task easier - just ask.

This work is built upon the efforts made by many people to gather knowledge of GSM. 

First very significant effort of public research into GSM and its security vulnerabilities was The Hacker's Choice GSM SCANNER PROJECT. One of the results of this project was creation of a software GSM receiver by *Tvoid* - *gsm-tvoid* - which was  was the most important predecessor of *gr-gsm* and of *gsm-receiver* from the *Airprobe* project.

*Gr-gsm* wouldn't be also possible without help and inspiration by Harald Welte, Dieter Spaar and Sylvain Munaut.

Special thanks to Pawel Koszut who generously lent his USRP1 to the author of *gr-gsm* (Piotr Krysik) in 2007-2010.
