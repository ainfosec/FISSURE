BTBB Wireshark plugin

This is the Bluetooth baseband plugin for Wireshark, it also includes an LMP
level dissector.

To build this on Debian/Ubuntu/BackTrack linux distributions:
  sudo apt-get install wireshark-dev wireshark
  cd libbtbb/wireshark/plugins/btbb/
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  make install

This will install to the .wireshark/ in your home directory.  To override this
set the DESTDIR environment variable when running cmake.
