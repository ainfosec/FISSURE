==========
Components
==========

FISSURE is a tool suite and RF framework consisting of dedicated Python components networked together for the purpose of RF device assessment and vulnerability analysis.

Overview
========

FISSURE stemmed from the need to quickly identify and react to unknown devices or devices operating in unidentified modes in a congested RF environment. Over the years it has grown into an in-house laboratory tool used by AIS for nearly all things RF.

Communications
--------------

The major components for FISSURE are written in Python/PyQt and communicate over an IP network to a central hub using ZeroMQ. Each component has a direct connection to the hub but can also have an unlimited number of one-to-many connections to broadcast status messages to other components. Any number of custom components can be added to the framework as long as the inputs/outputs are clearly defined in YAML and adhere to a simple message schema that allows for input sanitization and error handling.

Library
-------

Library utilities for browsing; searching; uploading images; adding/removing modulation types, packet types, signals of interest, statistics, demodulation flow graphs, and attacks.

Dashboard
=========

.. _Dashboard Concepts:

Concepts
--------

The User Dashboard is the means for the operator to configure FISSURE and communicate with and view information from the other components. It offers several other features that do not require their own dedicated component including:
  
- A packet crafter for protocols found the FISSURE library. It includes Scapy integration for transmitting different types of 802.11 packets while in monitor mode.
- Library utilities for browsing; searching; uploading images; adding/removing modulation types, packet types, signals of interest, statistics, demodulation flow graphs, and attacks.
- Menu items for launching standalone GNU Radio flow graphs.
- Third-party and online tools as menu items organized by protocol or application.
- Lessons and tutorials for interacting with various RF protocols.
- Help pages for operation and development, protocol reference material, calculators, and hardware instructions.
- Buttons for: assigning RF-enabled hardware to individual components (USRP B205mini, B210, X300 series; HackRF; bladeRF; LimeSDR; 802.11x Adapters; RTL2832U; Open Sniffer); probing the hardware for diagnostics; and acquiring IP address, daughterboard, and serial number information.

Target Signal Identification
============================

The Target Signal Identification (TSI) component runs four subcomponents: a detector, a signal conditioner, a feature extractor, and a classifier. 

The Detector subcomponent allows the operator to configure scan parameters for multiple search bands with the goal of reporting the power, frequency, and time of observed signals. 

The Signal Conditioner subcomponent will be responsible for isolating and conditioning signals from a stream of raw I/Q data for more detailed analysis. 

The Feature Extractor subcomponent will accept the conditioned signals and extract a predetermined list of signal characteristics dependent on the AI/ML method chosen for classification. 

The Signal Classifier subcomponent will interpret the feature sets and make specific conclusions such as the confidence levels for protocol and emitter classification. 
   
Protocol Discovery
==================

The Protocol Discovery component is responsible for identifying and reversing RF protocols to help extract meaningful data from unknown signals. It is designed to: accept signal of interest information, iterate flow graphs to perform recursive demodulation techniques, deduce protocol methods, assign confidence levels, analyze a bitstream, calculate CRC polynomials, and create custom Wireshark dissectors.

Flow Graph/Script Executor
==========================

The Flow Graph/Script Executor component runs flow graphs or Python scripts to perform single-stage attacks, multi-stage attacks, fuzzing attacks, IQ recording and playback, live signal inspection/analysis, and transmit playlists of signal data constructed with files downloaded from an online archive.

HIPRFISR
========

The Central Hub receives commands from the User Dashboard to distribute to other components, manages automation and editing of the main library - which contains RF protocol information, script and flow graph mappings, and observation data.
