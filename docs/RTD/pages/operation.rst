FISSURE is meant for people of all skill levels. Students or beginners can navigate through lessons and tutorials on how to interact with various wireless technologies. The User Dashboard offers friendly visual aids that demonstrate the RF device assessment process from start to finish. Beginners can also evade the hurdle that is traditionally associated with installing open-source tools - as the installer consists of a list of checkboxes for installing programs and dependencies. Meanwhile developers, educators, and researchers can use the framework for their daily tasks or to expose their cutting-edge solutions to a wider audience. Future development will draw heavily from feedback and interaction with the open-source community.
