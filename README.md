# FISSURE - The RF Framework 

<img src="/docs/Icons/README/logo.png"  width="820" height="90">

**Frequency Independent SDR-based Signal Understanding and Reverse Engineering**

FISSURE is an open-source RF and reverse engineering framework designed for all skill levels with hooks for signal detection and classification, protocol discovery, attack execution, IQ manipulation, vulnerability analysis, automation, and AI/ML. The framework was built to promote the rapid integration of software modules, radios, protocols, signal data, scripts, flow graphs, reference material, and third-party tools. FISSURE is a workflow enabler that keeps software in one location and allows teams to effortlessly get up to speed while sharing the same proven baseline configuration for specific Linux distributions.

The framework and tools included with FISSURE are designed to detect the presence of RF energy, understand the characteristics of a signal, collect and analyze samples, develop transmit and/or injection techniques, and craft custom payloads or messages. FISSURE contains a growing library of protocol and signal information to assist in identification, packet crafting, and fuzzing. Online archive capabilities exist to download signal files and build playlists to simulate traffic and test systems. 

The friendly Python codebase and user interface allows beginners to quickly learn about popular tools and techniques involving RF and reverse engineering. Educators in cybersecurity and engineering can take advantage of the built-in material or utilize the framework to demonstrate their own real-world applications. Developers and researchers can use FISSURE for their daily tasks or to expose their cutting-edge solutions to a wider audience. As awareness and usage of FISSURE grows in the community, so will the extent of its capabilities and the breadth of the technology it encompasses.

## Getting Started

**Supported**

There are three branches within FISSURE to make file navigation easier and reduce code redundancy. The Python2_maint-3.7 branch contains a codebase built around Python2, PyQt4, and GNU Radio 3.7; the Python3_maint-3.8 branch is built around Python3, PyQt5, and GNU Radio 3.8; and the Python3_maint-3.10 branch is built around Python3, PyQt5, and GNU Radio 3.10.

Operating System            |  FISSURE Branch
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
| Ubuntu 18.04 (x64) | Python2_maint-3.7 | 
| Ubuntu 18.04.5 (x64) | Python2_maint-3.7 |
| Ubuntu 18.04.6 (x64) | Python2_maint-3.7 |
| Ubuntu 20.04.1 (x64) | Python3_maint-3.8 |
| Ubuntu 20.04.4 (x64) | Python3_maint-3.8 |
| Ubuntu 20.04.5 (x64) | Python3_maint-3.8 |
| Ubuntu 20.04.6 (x64) | Python3_maint-3.8 |
| KDE neon 5.25 (x64) | Python3_maint-3.8 |
| Ubuntu 22.04 (x64) | Python3_maint-3.10 |

**In-Progress (beta)**

These operating systems are still in beta status. They are under development and several features are known to be missing. Items in the installer might conflict with existing programs or fail to install until the status is removed.

Operating System            |  FISSURE Branch
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
| DragonOS Focal (x86_64) | Python3_maint-3.8 |
| Parrot OS 5.2 (amd64) | Python3_maint-3.8 |
| DragonOS FocalX (x86_64) | Python3_maint-3.10 |
| Kali 23.1 (x64) | Python3_maint-3.10 |
| BackBox Linux 8 (amd64) | Python3_maint-3.10 |

Note: Certain software tools do not work for every OS. Refer to [Software And Conflicts](/docs/Help/Markdown/SoftwareAndConflicts.md)

**Installation** 
```
git clone https://github.com/ainfosec/FISSURE.git
cd FISSURE
git checkout <Python2_maint-3.7> or <Python3_maint-3.8> or <Python3_maint-3.10>
git submodule update --init
./install
```

This will install PyQt software dependencies required to launch the installation GUIs if they are not found. The git submodule command will download all missing GNU Radio out-of-tree modules from their repositories.

Next, select the option that best matches your operating system (should be detected automatically if your OS matches an option).

Python2_maint-3.7            |  Python3_maint-3.8            |  Python3_maint-3.10
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![install1b](/docs/Icons/README/install1b.png)  |  ![install1a](/docs/Icons/README/install1a.png)  |  ![install1c](/docs/Icons/README/install1c.png)

It is recommended to install FISSURE on a clean operating system to avoid conflicts with existing software. The items listed under the "Minimum Install" category are what is required to launch the FISSURE Dashboard without errors. Select all the recommended checkboxes (Default button) to avoid additonal errors while operating the various tools within FISSURE. There will be multiple prompts throughout the installation, mostly asking for elevated permissions and user names. 

If an item contains a "Verify" section at the end, the installer will run the command that follows and highlight the checkbox item green or red depending on if any errors are produced by the command. Checked items without a "Verify" section will remain black following the installation.

</p>

The FISSURE installer is helpful for staging computers or installing select software programs of interest. The code can be quickly modified to allow for custom software installs. The size estimates for the programs are before and after readings from a full install. The sizes for each program are not exact as some dependencies are installed in previously checked items. The sizes may also change over time as programs get updated.
